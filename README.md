You need to have JDK 9 or higher installed in order to execute the Runnable Jar. 
If you want to build the project by yourself, install also Maven 3.5.0 or higher and run mvn clean install in the root folder. 

Afterwards, you can find the Jar in semantic_web_project/target/semantic_web_project-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar
